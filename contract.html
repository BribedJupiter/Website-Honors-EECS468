        <!-- Section 3: The Founder -->
        <div id="founder">
            <h1>Our Founder: John Smith</h1>
            <p class="founder">Our founder, John Smith, graduated top of his class from the College of Video Game Sciences at The University of 
            the Moon in 1996. After graduating, he went on to found Swordfight Studios and to personally develop one of 
            the most loved video games of all time, <em>Earthquake: 1755</em>. He earned his MBA from The Business School of Business
            in 2004 and, since stepping down as CEO in 2007, has taken on an executive producer role in order to spend more time with his 
            family. He lives in Boston, MA with his wife, four children, and cat. </p>
            <p class="founder">When asked by a reporter during an interview in 2007 back in his hometown of Sacramento, CA "What was the most pivotal moment of you career?" 
            John responded: <blockquote class="feature" id="john_quote">"Definitely the release of <em>Earthquake: 1755</em>. It really shook
            the industry at a time when the industry wasn't quite ready for it. Overall though,
            I'd say it turned into a growth opportunity for us all. Since then, Swordfight Studios has 
            quite simply crushed it and I couldn't be prouder."</blockquote></p>
